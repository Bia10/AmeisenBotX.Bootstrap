Silently launches all servers neeed to run AmeisenBot.

Assumes you have at least done that once manualy and sucesfully.

The paths are defined in Main().

Althou it should redirect errors/out for reason unknown it doens't work, so if error occurs during one server init your fuked :D

When the launch is done the processes will continue running until manual termination!
